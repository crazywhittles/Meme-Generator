Start by typing "npm start" in terminal

How to use:

Enter text in the top and/or bottom text inputs.
The text will automatically update on the picture.
You can change the picture by clicking "chose file".
You are only able to upload image files.
A maximum of 50 letters can be in the text inputs.
You can change the colour of the text.

Features:

- Added a font colour selector where you can chose what colour you want the text.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed bug where you could upload any file, so I have added `accept="image/*"` tag to the input.

- Made the maximum height of the image to 600px, minimum 500px and a minimum width of 80%, so
there is no issues of the image being to big or small, and the image will stretch to size.

- Set the maximum letters of the inputs to 50 letters, so you can no longer type infinite
letters that go off the screen.
